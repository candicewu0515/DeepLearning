# DeepLearning

gen_datafpeaks_2tis.ipynb
Process the narrowPeak file, apply the logic of data processing and feature extraction, and generate the training/testing/validation model

Tune_hyperparams.py
Tunes hyperparameters.

Utils.py
Supports PyTorch model training, validation, loading, and other operations. The module encapsulates commonly used tool functions

metrics.py
Calculates AUC.

neural_network.py
Describes model architecture.

Loading_data.py
Describes loaders for data.

Fitnetwork.py
Fits the network.

Test.py
A pre-trained neural network model is used to evaluate the data and finally the results of the performance evaluation, such as ROC and PR curves, are generated and presented.
